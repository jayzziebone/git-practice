#Practice git

## Commands used
- git init: Create a repository
- git status: Compare working directory. staging area, and current branch
- git add: Add changes from working directory to staging area
- git commit: commit changes from staging area to current branch
- git commit -m "xxx": Commit changes with a message description
- git config: Set or get configuration
- git log: Show the history ("aka log") of the project commits
- git checkout: Check out branch (update HEAD and apply changes to working directory)

## Merging

Merging means to bring changes from one branch to another

- a fast-forward merge happens when the target branch was branched from the current one, and there are no new changes to the current branch since then.
